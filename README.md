# DC2_cluster_sprint

This repository is used to describe work done during the Argonne Sprint/Hack week (Dec 2017). We plan to run DM stack (obs_file) on DC2 images to make shape measurements.

TODO List:

- [x] Get some preliminary DC2 images. (Keep tracking this issue:https://github.com/LSSTDESC/DC2_Repo/issues/33)

- [ ] Initial tests with one single sensor to obtain feasible configurations.

- [ ] Tests with one single raft to check if the measurements in each sensor look reasonable.

- [ ] Run obs_file on more rafts.

- [ ] Plot mass map with shear measurements.
